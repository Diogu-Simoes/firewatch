# [Click here to add this bot to your discord!](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=999712607227359274&permissions=140123827264&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

## Info:
This was my first atempt at a discord bot and my first interaction with the discord.py library after coming up with the idea for FIREWATCH.  
I am open to sugestions and all kinds of feedback on the code, since I myself know there is a lot that can be improved.

When adding the bot to your discord you may notice that it requires more permissions than it uses, this is because there are plans to improve upon the current framework and display methods, making it so users don't have to readd the bot if it ever does get updated.  
That, of course, is only possible if I ever get some help or learn more about the library on my free time.

And on that note, below is a task list with some of the plans I would personaly love to see on the FIREWATCH bot.  

### Task list:

- [ ] Add compatibility for mobile (I have been trying and can't seem to get the app commands to work on mobile)
- [ ] Make the fire list display more user friendly through the use of webhooks
- [ ] Show a satelite image of the fire location when displaying it (Using LAT/LONG from the api)
